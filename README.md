README text coming soon! It was a hackathon, so please excuse the current lack of documentation and tests :)

We ended up winning first prize at the event netting a total of $5,000. A special thanks to @CodeRWB's team and sponsors. We hope people in Louisville find use for this and enjoy hacking on this too.
